# ticketsub

A simple ticketing system for air travelers. 

This smart contract allows airlines to issue tickets.

Every time a ticket is purchased, an NFT will be sent to the user. Users can by ticket using token which will be sent to the admin wallet.

The user signs using their wallet to redeem the ticket for the actual flight. 
This confirms the possession of the ticket. This also prevents the administrator from redeeming user's ticket without their consent.
The admin can delete an unsold ticket. Users can also transfer the NFT to other user but not the actual ticket.

This code is not production ready.
